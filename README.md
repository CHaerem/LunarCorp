# 🌙 Lunar Corp - Extraterrestrial Cheese Mining Division

> *"Brie-the easier with automation"*

## About

Welcome to **Lunar Corp**, the premier lunar cheese mining operation saving France from the great fromage crisis of 2026!

With Earth's cheese mines depleted and the French government in its 150th year of hung parliament, it falls to the private sector to save the day. Under the leadership of Jean-Claude Fromage, CEO and illustrious heir of the Fromage dynasty, we're extracting premium cheese from the Moon's plentiful lodes.

This command center helps manage our extraterrestrial operations, track production, and most importantly - keep those wine-drinking, strike-happy workers productive.
